<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

This part of the readme is where community involvement can happen! Normally we would have the Github setup to where anyone can fork and push or make an issue, but 
we are still learning that stuff. In the mean time this is how the section would look like. Pretty much from the Template. <br>

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".


1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Added some Goated new feature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/NewFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
